    <p class = "text" id = "about_paragraph">
        I'm a self taught iOS and Node.js developer who's loved coding since 4th grade. I've done work in a variety of fields from backend development to UI Design to rapid prototyping. I'm also an enthusiastic member of the Maker movement. I was inspired at an early age to build a robot (which I did!) and have building bigger and bigger things since. One of the projects I've worked on, The Grid, has won over 10 Maker Faire Editor's Choice ribbons at Maker Faires across the country.
